# Excelr P269 Internship Project Group2 Oil Price Prediction And Forecasting Using Python

 # OBJECTIVE:
 
"Oil is a product that goes completely in a different direction for a single market event as
the oil prices are rarely based on real-time data, instead, it is driven by externalities
making our attempt to forecast it even more challenging."

"As the economy will be highly affected by oil prices our model will help to understand
the pattern in prices to help customers and businesses to make smart decisions."

# Sample Data Set Details:

"Extraction of the data from various web sources."
